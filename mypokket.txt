You are free to use the web/search engines/code snippets, however you must be able to explain the code that you use. Ensure the code adheres to production standards (i.e., following all best practices).

Please complete Q1 
before attempting Q2.

Evaluation will be based on Q&A, functional correctness, robustness and adherence to coding standards. 

All the best!
